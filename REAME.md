# Exercise:

## Objectives

Your objective is to create a server that can handle a post request to “/newsletter_signup”
You must read and decode the request body (which will contain a name and email), and append the contact information to a csv file (your newsletter list)
CONSTRAINT: When the client request is a “POST” method to the url “/newsletter_signup”, you will emit a ‘signup’ event. A listener associated with this event will handle your logic
Getting Started

In VS Code, create and open a new folder named node_events
Create an server.js file
Import “EventEmitter” from the events module
You will also need the path, http, and fs modules imported to use

## PART 1:

Using the EventEmitter class, create a new EventEmitter instance called “NewsLetter”
Instantiate a new server instance with createServer
Inside the server request handler, listen for the ‘data’ event to be emitted, and pass in a callback function that pushes each ‘chunk’ into an array named ‘chunks’
Listen for the request ReadStream ‘end’ event, and pass in a callback that contains a conditional statement (if/else)
The conditional statement will check the request url and method, and if they are “POST” and “/newsletter_signup”, decode the chunks array with Buffer.concat().toString(), and use JSON.parse() on the result to access the request body values
Next, emit a ‘signup’ event, and pass in the value to be used by your event listener callback (name + email for csv record)
Write and end the response to the client

## PART 2

Account for any method or url that is not “POST” + “/newsletter_signup”
Outside of your server request handler, add an event listener for a ‘signup’ event on the NewsLetter EventEmitter
Pass in a callback that takes in a ‘contact’ as a parameter
This function should use fs.appendFile() to add the contact to a csv file in your project directory
Account for errors
Initialize the node app and test with Postman

## BONUS

A get request to your “/newsletter_signup” endpoint should send back an html page with a form
This form should have labels and inputs for name and email
This form should send the name and email as the request body to your server to process and add to your newsletter.csv file (you’ve already completed this logic)
If the action is successful or unsuccessful, display feedback to the user on the html page
